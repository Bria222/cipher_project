# Caesar Cipher
A Caesar cipher is a type of substitution in which each letter is shifted a certain number of places also known as a key, down the alphabet.  For example, with a shift of 1, A would be replaced by B, B would become C, and so on. This is an encryption program that takes in text input from a user and encrypts the inputed text . It only encrypts letters with the user providing the encryption key which must be between numbers 1-26.
